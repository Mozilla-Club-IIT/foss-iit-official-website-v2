                FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community of IIT was initiated in our
                university in November 2020 to promote the use and development of free and
                open-source software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the FOSS community is new to IIT, we have already conducted programs to
                advance the club's progress and collaborated for events with the FOSS communities of
                reputed universities to advocate and is responsible for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Mozilla Campus Club of Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) has been in a
                society with a long-standing reputation for hosting sessions and events that
                encourage students to contribute to keeping resources and information on the
                Internet public and accessible to all.
